    Website to play tic-tac-toe against an AI opponent that always plays optimally. It was an assignment for web development class at Warsaw University of life sciences. I have decided to approach this task ambitiously and implemented an AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm.

# About The Project
This project aims to create something interesting without using computationally expensive libraries. The most basic developer tools were used, allowing the website to be fast without unnecessary overhead. The application is available in the browser and meets the requirements of responsive design.

Have Fun! ðŸ˜„

# Getting Started
Just visit the publicly available demo on my website [DEMO](https://kbrw.pl/PWI1/). If you find my work interesting, I encourage you to read more on my homepage [kbrw.pl](https://kbrw.pl/).

<br>

# Usage
There are two game modes available: **Singleplayer** and **Multiplayer**.

## Singleplayer
In this game mode, you play as the circle, and the AI opponent responds to your moves. To place your move, simply click or tap on any empty square. At any moment, you can use the reset button to clear the board. If you manage to win against my algorithm, please send me a screenshot at [krzysztofborowski02@gmail.com](mailto:krzysztofborowski02@gmail.com) ðŸ˜„.

## Multiplayer
This game mode is designed for two players sharing the same device. Players take turns as usual. The first player is assigned the circle, and the second player always plays as crosses.

<br>

## Game rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid with 9 empty squares.
2. The first player always plays as circles, and the second plays as crosses.
3. Players choose empty squares to place their symbol.
4. Players take turns alternately.
5. If any row, column, or diagonal is filled with symbols of any player, then the game ends, and that player wins the game.
